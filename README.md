This is example code from an assignment for MSc in Computer Science that received a 92 Distinction grade

The code is a hybrid of a post fix and in fix reverse Polish notation calculator written in Java. I recommend starting at the SRPN Class. We exceeded the requirements by using a mutliple stack approach and REGEX to create a hybrid post/infix calculator
